# How to use the docs

Here's a brief introduction on how to build and display the docs locally during the writing

## prerequisites

The docs are built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) build with Node.js.

To avoid package locks nightmare, `npm` will be used (instead of `yarn` or `pnpm`).

### Modules install

Before using Docusaurus, the module needs to be installed with:

```shell
npm install
```

## Writing docs

To avoid early complexity, the sidebar displaying the links to the different docs is set to be autogenerated.

The structure in Docusaurus is as follows:

* Pages: all the docs go inside `/docs` directory. If a directory is created, it will be automatically be taken in consideration for the page links.
  * Links: to ensure a good flexibility, always use relative links when linking to another docs page (i.e. `[Intro](./intro)`) instead of absolute links (i.e. `[Intro](/intro)`).

    :::tip
    1. There's no need to add the `.md` file extension in links.
    1. The relative links are automatically transformed to versioned links if Docusaurus versioning is enabled
    :::

* Images: all the image go inside `/static/img` and can be referenced using their full path (i.e. `![Alt text for the logo](/img/logo.png)`)

  :::note
  In order to use globally the images in `/img`, the `MDXComponents` have been [swizzled](https://docusaurus.io/docs/swizzling). This is a Docusaurus feature which avoids to have local modules imports.

  Here's the result of the example above:

  ![Alt text for the logo](/img/logo.png)

## Inner loop: displaying while the docs writing

Docusaurus has several built-in Markdown enhancements, so it's better to display the docs in a browser instead of using, for example, the markdown preview in VSCode.

To display the docs, in a terminal run:

```shell
npm run start
```

Once the changes are saved, the terminal should display the docs have been compiled successfully and the web page should be reloaded automatically (if not, reload the page manually).

  :::warning
  The "live display" has several limitations, one being that it doesÂ´t check for broken links. Therefore, even if everything looks fine, **always** build the docs locally before committing the changes.
  :::

## Build the docs

Once all the changes are done, build the docs to ensure there's no errors (i.e. broken links):

```shell
npm run build
```

If the build is successful, commit the changes.
