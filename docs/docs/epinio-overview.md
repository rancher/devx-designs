# Epinio 

## A lightweight, Kubernetes-native PaaS

[Epinio](https://epinio.io) installs into any Kubernetes cluster to bring your
application from source code to deployment and allow for Developers and
Operators to work better together.

When installed with Rancher Prime, it provides a different path through the
developer-facing portion of the application delivery workflow, but can be tied in to the overall structure of [GitOps for Rancher](../Rancher-GitOps/overview.md).

Developed originally by SUSE, Epinio is now maintained and supported by
[Krumware](https://krum.io) in partnership with SUSE. This design provides a UI
and API specifically for app developers (independent of the source code control
used).
