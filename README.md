# SUSE DevX validated designs

This repository contains documentation, automation scripts, and other code
artifacts for validated designs enabling end-to-end software development on SUSE
Rancher Prime. These designs focus on developer ease of use, build automation,
continuous deployment, security, and maintainability. 

Some designs will use SUSE Rancher Prime components, while others will
incorporate features available from SUSE certified partners. 

Discussion about this initiative is currently happening in the SUSE 
[#proj-devx](https://app.slack.com/client/T02863RC2AC/C088797UWCA) Slack channel
(internal), but will expand to the wider SUSE Rancher community soon.

## Contributing

SUSE welcomes contributions from members of the [SUSE One Partner
Program](https://www.suse.com/partners/) that want to work with us to broaden
the range of software delivery platform designs. We aim to include designs that
use SUSE software in conjunction with software from SUSE partners which can be
implemented by knowledgeable platform engineers.

See the [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) guide for the parameters for DevX
Validated Designs and how to contribute them.
