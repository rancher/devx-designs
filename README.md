# SUSE DevX validated designs

This repository contains documentation, automation scripts, and other code
artifacts for validated designs enabling end-to-end software development on SUSE
Rancher Prime. These designs focus on developer ease of use, build automation,
continuous deployment, security, and maintainability. 

Some designs will use SUSE Rancher Prime components, while others will
incorporate features available from SUSE certified partners. 

Discussion about this initiative is currently happening in the SUSE 
[#proj-devx](https://app.slack.com/client/T02863RC2AC/C088797UWCA) Slack channel
(internal), but will expand to the wider SUSE Rancher community at and
after SUSECON 2025.
